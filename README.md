# ☁️ Weather App (API & JavaScript)

This project is a simple, front-end weather application built for portfolio purposes, demonstrating practical skills in working with external APIs and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using Vanilla JavaScript.

**As a QA i wanted to proof my knowledge of programming languages and to build my own app to practice playwright automation**

### 🛠️ Technologies and Core Skills
* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS).
* **API Proficiency:** Asynchronously fetching and handling weather data from a third-party service [Insert API name, e.g., OpenWeatherMap].
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamic creation and updating of the weather card based on the JSON response.
* **Security Best Practice:** Implementation of a `.gitignore` file to protect the API key and ensure a clean, secure repository history.



### 🚀 How to Run Locally
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies (if applicable).
3.  **Create a `config.js` file** and place your personal API key inside it.
4.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
